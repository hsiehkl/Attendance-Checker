(Reference: [gspread](https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html))

To access spreadsheets via Google Sheets API we need to authenticate and authorize the application.

### step 1: Enable API Access
* Head to [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project) and create a new project (or select the one you already have).
* In the box labeled “Search for APIs and Services”, search for “Google Drive API” and enable it.
* In the box labeled “Search for APIs and Services”, search for “Google Sheets API” and enable it.

### step 2: Create a Service Account
* Go to “APIs & Services > Credentials” and choose “Create credentials > Service account key”.
* Fill out service account details.
* Set up service account permissions by selecting the role as Project > Editor.
* Select "ADD KEY" and create a new key as JSON format. (A JSON file should be automatically downloaded.)

### step 3: Set up environment
* Move JSON file to cred folder.
* Rename the JSON File to credentials.json
* Open credentials.json, find the value of client_email and copy it.
* Open your Google Sheets, click Share button and add this email into user group.
